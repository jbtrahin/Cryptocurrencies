# Cryptocurrencies
Use unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency data.

## Module Overview
In this module, You’ll work primarily with the K-means algorithm, the main unsupervised algorithm that groups similar data into clusters. We’ll build on this by speeding up the process using principal component analysis (PCA), which employs many different features.

## Project Overview
In this challenge, you’ll use unsupervised learning to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded on the market.

The goals of this challenge are for you to:

1. Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
2. Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
3. Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
4. Create some plots and data tables to present your results.
